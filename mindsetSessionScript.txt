Script for “Mindset and Developer” session part of the workshop

Opening is Ask them what are the best companies in software. 
Then start the imagination process
- close your eyes, take few deep breaths, take them through the interview process. Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple. 
- Ask and know their imagination.
- Ask them to talk on the stage.
- Again now take them through the best possible imagination.
- Ask them how they felt.
- Explain the importance of this imagination 
- Tell them to do before going to bed and as and then they wake up
- If your desire is to start a successful company, then imagine that successful path.
- If gate rank imagine that, what ever imagine that.
- The working of sub conscious mind.
- Our mind is good at fooling us. The easiest person to fool is yourself 

Lets's look into mindset
- fixed vs growth mindset
- Form groups of 4-5 people
- Read the article 
- Discuss within your group, discuss areas in which each of you are fixed or growth mindset
- Come to the stage and explain 3 groups
- I will explain my fixed vs growth mindset real examples
- You need to reach your maximum potential 

Now let's do firings 
- he does his job well but passes comments on others and create headaches to others Vs his does his job well, goes well with others.
- He does his job well, but does not help anyone Vs he does his job and helps the team members 
- He does what is told Vs he does what is given and also identifies new problems and comes up with solutions. Also activity lists all the opportunities.
- He is demotivated Vs he is highly motivated. 
Now let's do hiring 
- Good marks vs my code is on github 
- Participated in technical events in colleges vs these are my contribution to open source 
- I know all these languages and technologies Vs I have build these applications, the apps are being used by these many people, these are done just for fun and it's code is on github
- Give me job and training, I will prove myself Vs I have done internships in these companies, these are the things I have built, in my LinkedIn page you can see the feedback on my work

Difference between rules and principles
“A rule says, “You must do it this way.” A principle says, “This works … and has through all remembered time.”

You have all the common sense that is needed. Just put it to use. 

The easiest person to fool is yourself. 

Stop giving reasons, we have masted the art of coming  with perfect reasons in all situations.

Correct instead of doing this application and solving these problems and writing programs, it's time saving to read the FAQs, let me read FAQs.

You commit to yourself. Once you commit don't listen to yourself.

To do anything worth while, it takes effort. That's when mind starts generating reasons instead of finding solutions to the current situation

Summarise the first session.
- how subconsciously you take decisions, how to influence your subconscious mind
- Growth mindset, always put efforts and reach your maximum potential
- Internships and work on interested projects and build fun or useful applications 
- Stop giving reasons to yourself
